# UFOs

## Overveiw: 
##### The purpose of theis assignment was to integrate JavaScript to manipulate HTML code to build a working website that could hold data tables. This website consists of information surrounding UFO sightings. It allows one to filter these sighting by date, city, state, country, and shape. This will filter this information and provide a table that include the information that was entered along with the duration of th esighting and the a comment section to further descibe the UFO sighting in detail.

## Results: 

##### The web page has been organized to present 5 different filter options that will organize the information in a table-like formation.

## Summary:
The drawback of this webpage is that it does not register the information that is enetered in the filter the data. It only presents the data in the order.
I would reccommend adding a filter for time of day rather than only the date as well as making the filter have the abillity to have a summary option that can list the total amount of sighting on a particular day, state or country.
